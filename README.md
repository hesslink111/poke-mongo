# Poke Mongo

### Description

This is an early-stage attempt at a Pokemon Go clone. This is an android application which uses the Google Maps API to display a user's current location and as well as the locations and avatars of nearby players and pokemon (based on my own server.

I made this to demonstrate to my friends that it was not impossible or difficult to implement tracking (the ability to see the distances to pokemon within 100 meters) on top of a reasonable geolocation architecture.

Language: Java
